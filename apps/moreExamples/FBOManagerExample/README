	Hey I just made an FBO example app - that uses Zach Gage's FBO code, with the ofAdvancedTexture and a render manager to manage multiple screens. The render manager is a continuation of the code started by other Zach (OF) adding in some new things:

	1 - Lets you set the internal texture coordinates for each screen and also the coordinates of each corner of the texture to do fast warping / projection correction.
	2 - set however many screens you want to split your FBO across.
	3 - Loads and saves to xml.
